- Performed Exploratory Data analysis on 2822 customers data with 25 features and created interactive plots.
- Trained Autoencoders to reduce dimensions and implemented KMeans Clustering. Found the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method. Added initial data to do some descriptive statistics at cluster level.
- Also applied PCA to reduce dimensions but results were not able to cluster data properly.
